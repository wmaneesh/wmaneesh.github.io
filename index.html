              A secure web based application that is geared towards Physicians,
              Nurses and other Healthcare workers to communicate efficiently in
              a Hospital setting.
              <br />
              The application allows Healthcare workers to upload, edit and read
              information about a patients condition. Generaly, Nurses would
              hand write patient notes and upload them at a physical terminal.
              This method was highly inefficient as it would cause delays into
              getting patient notes into the system if the Nurses were busy with
              their rounds. Our application allows the information to be
              securely uploaded to the hospitals system in an instant. The front
              end was build using the React framework, while the backend was
              built using Express js. The main database which held most of the
              data used MySQL, while the remainig, which consisted of the
              messaging system, used Firebase.

              An Embedded Systems Project built to automate the fan speed.<br />
              The embedded system controls the speed of a 12V DC fan depending
              on the ambient room temperature. Depending on the ambient room
              temperature, read from the onboard LM74 temperature sensor, the
              PWM duty cycle is adjusted. The displays show the current
              temperature, the mode of operation (Auto or Manual) and the fan
              speed. The button provides the user with the ability to to change
              between Automatic to Manual. When in manual mode the buttons can
              be used to change the fan speed from low, mid to high. The project
              was coded using Embedded C.

              A VLSI deisign that implements the Least Recently Used (LRU)
              algorithm for replacing memory in a 4-way set-associative cache in
              a 600nM processor.
              <br />
              The chip itself is consisted of several modules that were customly
              designed from Verilog code (testing with simulations) to
              schematics to the final layout. The two main modules were the
              Controller and Datapath. These two modules were the ones that
              implement the core LRU algorithm. The Controller was responsible
              for providing the control signals to the rest of the system base
              on the sate of a Finite State Machine (FSM). The Datapath was
              responsible for performing all the data processing operations. It
              consisted of a collection of functional units that performed the
              arithmetic operations.

              the UI before adding it to cart. The site used a base wordpress

              The game was created using the Singleton Design pattern. The
              intent for using this was that only one instance of the board was
              created. The chess pieces were created using the inheritance
              principle. For implementing undo/redo functionality to the game,
              Command Design pattern was used. The game can be played by typing
              commands such as setup_chess (piece, x, y), start_game, reset
              game, moves(x,y) and move_and_capture(initial_x, initial_y,
              final_x, final_y).

              A Traffic Light Controller created using a FBGA. <br />
              The learning outcome of this project was to understand how Finite
              State Machines work and their outputs. The output of the system
              depends on the current state and the previous state of the
              machine. For this project, the criteria was that the Highway light
              stays green until a request is made from a secondary road or the
              pedestian crossing in the intersection. The transition of the
              state depends on how long the green light has serviced and which
              road made the request in the previous state. The project was coded
              using Verilog.
